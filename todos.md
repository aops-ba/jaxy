# todos

- calibrations
  * line width, dot size, label margin
  * the four primal commands
- consolidate all the scatteredness in `render`
- reify aligns
- async first load
- everything in `understand` is a return, and then `Render.update` filters them out.
  maybe `understand` should just be more ramified instead.
